# Progress – Backend (v2)

Updated by the agents at the end of every work session.

## Current phase
Phase 0 – Preparation: **backend skeleton done** (2026-11-12). Online test environment (Supabase DB, test host) still waiting for the owner's accounts and the `attendance-deploy` agent.

Backend phase 0 is **ready for backend-security-tester** (security baseline: headers, generic JSON errors, neutral cookie names, trusted proxies).

### Legacy v1
The legacy Node/Mongo code was removed from the development branch. It remains on `main` at commit
`7e53efcbb392bb2ca8ec8dc5666e55939731b325` (the `legacy-v1` tag could not be pushed from this environment; the owner can create it with
`git tag legacy-v1 7e53efcbb392bb2ca8ec8dc5666e55939731b325 && git push origin legacy-v1`).

### Phase 0 backend – what exists
- Laravel 13 (PHP 8.3), API only, Sanctum installed (device tokens, no stateful SPA domains), PostgreSQL default, timezone `Africa/Accra`, locale `en`.
- Queue: database driver; mail: `log` by default, Resend native transport ready (`MAIL_MAILER=resend` + `RESEND_API_KEY`, not set).
- Security baseline: `App\Http\Middleware\SecurityHeaders` (removes `X-Powered-By`/`Server`, adds nosniff, DENY, no-referrer, CSP, HSTS on HTTPS, `no-store` on API), session cookie `sid`, cache prefix `att-cache-`, every error rendered as generic JSON by `App\Exceptions\ApiExceptionRenderer` (details only when `APP_DEBUG=true`), no web routes (all unknown paths = JSON 404), Laravel's `/up` page removed, `TRUSTED_PROXIES` env.
- `GET /api/health` → `{"status":"ok"}`.
- API contract: `docs/api/openapi.yaml` (repository only, not served).
- Tests: Pest on PostgreSQL (`attendance_test`), 14 tests green (44 assertions); Larastan level 8 clean; Pint clean.
- Docker: multi-stage FrankenPHP image (classic mode), roles app/worker/scheduler, `docker-compose.yml` (app, worker, scheduler, Postgres 16). See `docs/DOCKER.md`. The image was **not built in this environment** (no Docker daemon); the first CI/deploy build must confirm it.
- CI: `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` (Postgres service, composer install, pint --test, phpstan, pest, migrate + rollback).

### Authentication decision (P0-02, 2026-11-12) – for attendance-frontend
**Bearer device tokens only** (Sanctum personal access tokens, one per device). No cookie, no session, no CSRF route (`/sanctum/csrf-cookie` is not registered). The PWA stores the token on the device and sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; only a 401 logs the user out. See `docs/api/openapi.yaml`.

### How to run locally
See `README.md` (PHP + local PostgreSQL, or `docker compose up --build`).

### Next
- `backend-security-tester`: phase 0 baseline review.
- Phase 1 – backend foundations (schema, settings engine, roles/permissions, auth flows, device lockout, logs). The default `users` table from the skeleton will be replaced by the phase 1 schema.

| 8 – Production deployment | Not started | – | Requires the owner's written approval below |

## Deployment (attendance-deploy, 2026-11-12)
- CI backend (`backend-ci`): job `test` (Pint, Larastan, Pest on Postgres 16, reversible migrations) green; new job `docker-build` builds the production image (no push) and smoke-tests `/api/health` + absence of `Server`/`X-Powered-By` headers. Run 43202465378 (commit adcbe30): both jobs green; the image builds, `/api/health` returns 200, no `Server`/`X-Powered-By` header.
- CI frontend (`frontend-ci`): green (lint, format, typecheck, unit tests, build).
- Supabase `ynspiijfjpumatmszmhx` (Attendance_Manager, eu-west-1, Postgres 17): ACTIVE_HEALTHY, security advisors: no findings. No migration applied (phase 1). Note: CI uses Postgres 16, Supabase runs 17 – align CI to 17 in phase 1.
- Vercel: **blocked** – the Vercel connection used by the agents has no access to the account scope `benediction-ahouanse-s-projects` (403). No project created.
- Backend test host: Render approved by the owner (account to create); Render procedure ready in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` (backend repo).

## Blocked / questions for the owner
- **P0-01 – legacy v1 admin password in git history (owner action)**: a v1 admin password is readable in the repository history (`scripts/fixAdminPassword.js`, removed but still in history). Consider it compromised: change it on the v1 production admin and on any account that reuses it; never reuse it for v2. The history is not rewritten (force-push forbidden).
- **Vercel (owner action, still blocked 2026-11-12)**: after the connector re-authorization the Vercel API still returns `403 forbidden: Not authorized: Trying to access resource under scope "benediction-ahouanse-s-projects" (team_7rhgiQNsRJIXGdFxd45Eihlj)`; the connection lists no team. The re-authorization did not grant that scope. Either (a) re-authorize the Vercel connector in claude.ai Settings > Connectors and explicitly tick the scope "benediction-ahouanse-s-projects" in the Vercel consent screen, then ask the deploy agent to retry; or (b) create it yourself: Add New > Project > import `Benediction-aho/frontend_Attendance` (install the Vercel GitHub app on that repo if asked), framework Vite, build `npm run build`, output `dist`, env `VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.invalid/api` (Preview + Production). Preview deployments of `claude/upbeat-noether-f7defe` are then automatic.
- **Backend test host: Render approved by the owner.** Next step (owner): create the Render account (sign in with GitHub, give Render access to `Benediction-aho/backend_Attendance`), then tell us. Prepare, to be entered **only in Render secrets** (Environment tab of the service, never in chat or in the repository): the Supabase database password (Supabase dashboard > Project Settings > Database; reset it there if unknown), and later the Resend API key, Sentry DSN and VAPID keys. The deploy agent then creates the Docker web service, worker and cron following `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` section 3.
- Accounts to provide (see `PLAN_DEVELOPPEMENT.md` section 8): Supabase, Resend + sending domain, Vercel, backend test host.

## Owner approval for production
_Not given yet._

## Log
- 2026-11-12 – Phase 0 backend: legacy v1 removed, Laravel 13 skeleton, security baseline, Docker, CI.
- Specifications, agents and workflow added to the repository.
- Switched from native app (Capacitor) to PWA; automatic check-in now based on office Wi-Fi detection.
- Wi-Fi detection and automatic check-in removed; check-in = GPS perimeter + Face ID (passkey); fixed-time reminder at 08:05.
